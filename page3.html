                    My Name is Hendrix Madrideo, and I am looking to get into tech, 
                    through an apprenticeship/entry helpdesk level. 
                    I have been learning some code and IT on the side, 
                    since i first started engaging with code in secondary school with Some Visual Basic for Applications
                    for a database assessment during my GCSE's. During that time i would also get some IT work experience, 
                    and do further IT studies in the future with an IT A level, AS computing, and 1 year IT BTEC courses. 
                    During that time i would be introduced to Java, in AS Computing, and General IT knowledge and application with
                    an introduction to HTML/CSS, and Hardware Internals. <br>
                    Recently i have been getting back to more IT related interests
                    such as Coding within regards to web development, and have been refreshing my knowledge doing the google IT support certificate.
                    As of now i wish to continue pursuing IT, as i like bridging the gap in problems with IT related solutions.
